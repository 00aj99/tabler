## About Tabler

We’ve created this admin panel for everyone who wants to create any templates based on our ready components. Our mission is to deliver a user-friendly, clear and easy administration panel, that can be used by both, simple websites and sophisticated systems. The only requirement is a basic HTML and CSS knowledge—as a reward, you'll be able to manage and visualize different types of data in the easiest possible way!

After using many of different admin panels, no matter free or paid, we've noticed they all had a lot of defects—and the main one was resource intensity.
They were loading loads of useless components that you wouldn't ever use, so we've decided to choose a different way. The whole system is plugin-based, what means that you have a control over what is needed and what not.

To make the system works fast and reliable, we've converted most of the components to CSS. Thanks to this, you don't have to load a lot of unnecessary libraries into your browser what really boosts the overall speed.
